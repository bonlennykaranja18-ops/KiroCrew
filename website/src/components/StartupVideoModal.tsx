 * does watching it mean". The split is what keeps the policy testable without the
 * dashboard and keeps this chunk lazy.
 *
 * The clip retires PERMANENTLY, by one of two verdicts, and both are one-way:
 * `seen` when the user watches most of it or presses the acknowledgement, and
 * `dismissed` when they close it. Neither is a snooze — the backend stops
 * offering a clip after either — so there is no "remind me" affordance here to
 * imply otherwise.
 *
 * The clip's BYTES are not fetched until the user asks for them: `preload="none"`
 * plus a `poster` means the browser draws the still and waits for a play. A
 * launch that shows no video (the overwhelming majority) costs one small JSON
 * response and no media at all.
